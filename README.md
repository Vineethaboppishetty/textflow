# textflow
In this example there are two textboxes and three buttons
the first textbox where the user inputs text 
the first button (>>) is used to float the text to the right textbox 
the second button (||) pauses the flow of the text
the third button  (<<) is used to float the text to the left textbox
this text is now floated between the two textboxes depending on the button being pressed
